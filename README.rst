A quick demo of using the google AIY to play heart radio.

Its a bit hacky, but it works well.

You will need to enable google speech api and turn on cloud-speech in ~/.config/voice-recognizer.ini::

     cloud-speech = true

Copy action.py to ~/voice-recognizer-raspi/src

Albert Hickey did a similar implementation so also have a look at his project. http://www.winkleink.com/2017/05/raspberry-pi-3-with-google-aiy-voicehat.html
